# Java
This is some of my hobby during studies. I had lot of java code that I think maybe can be useful and fun for some beginners like me.
NOTE:
~ I just upload my code as when I want to check again, I realize I had lost the final_final_final_confim_final.java code
~ I had been introduce to github long ago but don't have time to use it as I think I would not need it and I am wrong
~ I will try to update again my code, some of it is not finish as I lost lot of my code form my studies. Last time I checking again my code is 2017 #but does not mean I did not code until now ~,~

Disclaimer: 
All my code is during my studies, if you have better way of code, kindly criticize as I am still learning day by day :)
